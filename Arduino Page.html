      <h2>What is Arduino</h2>
      <p>Arduino is an open-source electronics platform that uses simple hardware and software to make it easy to use. This platform has attracted a global community of makers, including students, hobbyists, artists, programmers, and professionals. Arduino boards can read inputs and convert them to outputs, such as turning on a motor or turning on an LED. Thousands of projects and applications have made use of Arduino. Beginners will find the Arduino software simple to use, but advanced users will find it adaptable. It is a great platform for teaching and learning about microcontrollers because it operates on Mac, Windows, and Linux</p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Hardware</h2>
      <p>Arduino is a hardware and software platform that is free to use. An Atmel 8-bit AVR microcontroller with flash memory, pins, and features is used in most Arduino boards. In 2012, the 32-bit Arduino Due, based on the Atmel SAM3X8E, was released. For other circuits, the Arduino board exposes the majority of the microcontroller's I/O pins. The Arduino Mini and Boarduino, for example, use a detachable USB-to-serial adaptor board. Standard AVR in-system programming (ISP) is utilized when using classic microcontroller tools.</p>

          For your first Arduino, the Uno is a fantastic choice. The ATmega328P microprocessor is used in this Arduino board. It is relatively easy to use when compared to other types of Arduino boards, such as the Arduino Mega type board. It has 14 digital I/O pins (six of which can be used as PWM outputs), six analog inputs, a reset button, a power jack, a USB connection, and an In-Circuit Serial
           Programming header (ICSP), among other things. It comes with everything you need to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a PC with a USB cable and power it up with an AC-to-DC adapter or battery.Please refer to this link to know more about <a href="https://www.elprocus.com/what-is-arduino-uno-r3-pin-diagram-specification-and-applications/" target="blank">Arduino Uno</a>

This type of microcontroller board is compact, long-lasting, adaptable, and dependable. It is compact when compared to the Arduino Uno board. The Arduino IDE and micro USB are required to complete the projects. Analog pins-8, digital pins-14 with a set of I/O pins, power pins-6, and RST (reset) pins-2 are the primary features of this board.

              The Arduino Mega is the larger brother of the Arduino UNO. It has a large number of digital I/O pins (14 of which can be used as PWM outputs), six analog inputs, a reset button, a power jack, a USB connection, and a reset button. It comes with everything you need to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a PC with a USB cable and power it up with an
               AC-to-DC adapter or battery. This Arduino board's large number of pins makes it ideal for applications that require a large number of digital i/ps or o/ps, such as several buttons.

            The Leonardo board is the Arduino's initial development board. This board has a single microcontroller and a USB port. That is to say, it might be really simple and inexpensive. Because this board handles USB directly, program libraries are available that allow the Arduino board to emulate a computer keyboard, mouse, and so on.

          <h2 class="subtitle">Software</h2>
          <p> A program for Arduino hardware may be written in any programming language with compilers that produce binary machine code for the target processor. Atmel provides a development environment for their 8-bit AVR and 32-bit ARM Cortex-M based microcontrollers: AVR Studio (older) and Atmel Studio</p>
       <div class="icon" style="font-size: 20px;margin-left: 3%;width: 30%;">IDE</div>
       <p>       The Arduino integrated development environment (IDE) is written in the Java programming language. It provides simple mechanisms to compile and upload programs to an Arduino board. The source code for the Arduino IDE is released under theÂ GNU General Public License, version 2.<br><br>
              The Arduino IDE supports the languages C and C++ using special rules of code structuring. The Arduino IDE supplies a software library from the Wiring project, which provides many common input and output procedures.The Arduino IDE employs the program avrdude to convert the executable code
               into a text file in hexadecimal encoding that is loaded into the Arduino board by a loader program in the board's firmware.</p>
               <div class="icon" style="font-size: 20px;margin-left: 3%;width: 30%;">Sketch</div>
               <p>A sketch is a program written with the Arduino IDE.[65] Sketches are saved on the development computer as text files with the file extension .ino. Arduino Software (IDE) pre-1.0 saved sketches with the extension .pde.</p>
              <p>A minimal Arduino C/C++ program consists of only two functions:
                <dl style="padding-left: 30px;font-family: Goudy Old Style;font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200;">
                  <dt><b><u>Setup()</u></b></dt>
                  <dd>- This function is called once when a sketch starts after power-up or reset. It is used to initialize variables, input and output pin modes, and other libraries needed in the sketch. It is analogous to the function main().</dd>
                  <dt><b><u>Loop()</u></b></dt>
                  <dd>- After setup() function exits (ends), the loop() function is executed repeatedly in the main program. It controls the board until the board is powered off or is reset. It is analogous to the function while(1)</dd>
